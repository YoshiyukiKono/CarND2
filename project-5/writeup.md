### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

#### Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
#### A polynomial is fitted to waypoints.If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.

...

### Model Predictive Control with Latency
#### The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.
